Docstring for chapter1.smart_salary_calculator!
Write a program for the accounting department of a startup company. This program should:

Take as input: employee name, base salary (in Tomans), and number of overtime hours.

Calculate:

The rate for each overtime hour is 1.5 times the regular hourly rate (assuming 160 hours of work per month).

If the total salary (base + overtime) was below 12 million Tomans, the tax is 0%.

If it was between 12 and 20 million, the tax is 10% on the amount in excess of 12 million.

If it was above 20 million, the tax is 20% on the amount in excess of 20 million (plus the previous tax bracket).

Output: Pay slip including name, gross salary, tax amount, and net salary received.
